# Three_body_periodic_orbits

The three-body problem is the problem of taking an initial set of data that specifies the positions, masses, and velocities of three bodies for some particular point in time and then determining the motions of the three bodies, in accordance with Newton’s laws of motion and of universal gravitation which are the laws of classical mechanics. Unlike two-body problems, there is no general closed-form solution for every condition and numerical methods are needed to solve and find periodic orbits. A prominent example of the classical three-body problem is the movement of a planet with a satellite around a star and a periodic solution to such a problem is the Earth, Sun and Moon. The goal of this project is to set up the physcial conditions behind the three-body problem and define a ‘search engine’ to find new periodic orbits.
